# s3kor
S3 tools built in GoLang using threads for fast parallel actions like copy, list and remove to S3.

Easiest way to install if you're on a Mac or Linux (amd64 or arm64)  is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Type:

```
brew tap sethkor/tap
brew install s3kor
```

For other platforms take a look at the releases in Github.  I build binaries for:

|OS            | Architecture                           |
|:------------ |:-------------------------------------- |
|Mac (Darwin)  | amd64 (aka x86_64)                     |
|Linux         | amd64, arm64, arm6, arm7, 386 (32 bit) |
|Windows       | amd64, 386 (32 bit)                    |

Let me know if you would like a particular os/arch binary regularly built.

Or build it yourself by go getting it:
```
go get github.com/sethkor/s3kor
```


The cli emulates the [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) as close as possible so as to be a drop in replacement.  Supported s3 operations:

- [X] List - ls
- [X] Remove - rm
- [X] Copy - cp
- [ ] Syncronize - sync

Use `--help` on the command line to help you along the way.

```cassandraql
usage: s3kor [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]

s3 tools using golang concurency

Flags:
  --help             Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  --profile=PROFILE  AWS credentials/config file profile to use
  --auto-region      Automatic region detection
  --region=REGION    AWS region
  --verbose          Verbose Logging
  --version          Show application version.

Commands:
  help [<command>...]
    Show help.

  rm [<flags>] <S3Uri>
    remove

  ls [<flags>] <S3Uri>
    list

  cp [<flags>] <source> <destination>
    copy
```

--profile will always look in the usual place for your aws `credentials` or `config` file

### Automatic region detection for your buckets
All commands can take the `--auto-region` flag to automatically detect the right region for your bucket operation, rather than you passing the specific region with `--region`.


## List - ls
Nothing special here.  Just remember S3 has prefixes, not directory paths.

## Remove - rm
```
  --recursive        Recurisvley delete
  --all-versions     Delete all versions
```

Both options can be used together in a single command.

Remember when using `--all-versions` to delete all versions of an object at once, the eventual consistency model of S3 applies.

When deleting a large number of objects, the final outcome may not be reflected by `ls` immediately due to eventual consistency.

## Copy - cp
This is WIP, some further features to come.  Please raise an issue if theres a specific feature you. would like considered or prioritised.

```
  -r, --recursive               Recursively copy
  -c, --concurrent=10           Maximum number of concurrent uploads to S3.
      --sse=AES256              Specifies server-side encryption of the object in S3. Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms.
      --sse-kms-key-id=SSE-KMS-KEY-ID  
                                The AWS KMS key ID that should be used to server-side encrypt the object in S3.
      --acl=private             Object ACL
      --storage-class=STANDARD  Storage Class

Args:
  <source>       file or s3 location
  <destination>  file or s3 location
```

Tha maximum. concurrent uploads (`--concurrent` or `-c`) is dependent not only on your upload bandwidth but also the maximum open file limits per process on your system and the performance of the soucre drive.  

You can check your file limits in linux, macos and other flavour of OS with `ulimit -n`.  Changing this limit in the os is possible and not always dangerous.  Instructions on how to change it vary between OS so they are not described here.  `s3kor` impacts these limits both in walking the file system and uploading the file so there is not a 1 to 1 correlation between the max limit ond the value you pass to `--concurrent`.  Try to pass `s3kor` a max value that is about 20% less than the systems max limit value.

Currently if you hit a file limit, the error is not reported

For optimal throughput consider using a S3 VPC Gateway endpoint if you are executing s3kor from within an AWS VPC.

And remember the performance of the source storage device is important, you don't want to choke it reading lots of data at once.  Use an optimized iops device or SAN.
  
## Sync - sync
This is WIP
